# 🦎 Calango AI

**Agile. Adaptable. Yours.**

**Calango AI** is a free, open-source desktop application that lets you chat with the world's smartest Artificial Intelligence (like GPT-4 and Claude 3) in a private, customizable environment.

Named after the agile Brazilian lizard, this app is built to be fast, resilient, and completely under your control. unlike web chats, **you** own the data, **you** pick the personality, and **you** decide how it looks.



## ✨ Why use Calango?

* **🎭 Shapeshifting Personas:** Don't just chat with a robot. Turn your AI into a **Python Expert**, a **Creative Writer**, or a **Pirate Captain** with a single click.
* **⚔️ The Danger Room:** Not sure which AI is smarter or cheaper? Pit two models against each other side-by-side to see who wins.
* **🎨 Authentic Brazilian Themes:** Customize your interface with high-contrast themes inspired by Brazil's native fauna and flora.
* **🔒 Privacy First:** Your API keys and chat history are stored **locally on your computer**. We don't see them. Big Tech doesn't see them. Only you see them.
* **💸 Pay As You Go:** Use your own API keys. This is often significantly cheaper than a $20/month subscription if you aren't a heavy user.



## 🎨 The Brazilian Touch

We ditched the generic "Dark Mode" for themes that celebrate the vibrant colors of Brazil:

* **🟨 Calango (Signature):** The agile survivor of the Cerrado. (High Contrast Yellow/Dark)
* **🟥 Tiê:** Inspired by the *Tiê-Sangue* (Brazilian Tanager), a bird with intense blood-red feathers.
* **🟦 Gralha:** The *Gralha Azul* (Azure Jay), the intelligent bird that plants the Araucaria forests in the south.
* **🌸 Boto:** The *Boto Cor-de-Rosa*, the shapeshifting legend of the Amazon rivers.
* **🟪 Ipê:** The resilient purple tree that blooms in the winter.

## ❓ FAQ

**Where is my data stored?**
Everything is saved in a hidden folder on your computer to ensure privacy:

* Windows: `C:\Users\You\.calango\`
* Mac/Linux: `/home/you/.calango/`

**Is this free?**
The software is 100% free and open source. However, the API keys you use (OpenAI/Anthropic) may charge you a small fee per message (usually fractions of a cent).
